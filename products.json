    "description": "Today American University of Phnom Penh (AUPP) announced the first ever Center for Leadership and Professional Development (CLPD) that will bring internationally recognized training programs to Cambodia in order to help train and improve human resources and capacity building in Cambodia and the ASEAN region. The scope of key offerings will be in priority areas such as general management, leadership development, project and program management, communication and negotiation skills, human resource management, and financial management. The center will also offer sector specific programs in tourism and aviation, teacher and school development, and management programs for key industries such as hospitality, travel and tourism, construction, and agriculture. While the planned average CLPD prices will be slightly above competition, they still offer a great value-for- money compared to what Cambodian companies are paying when sending their staff to overseas or neighboring countries for none-specialized or highly skilled types of training.",

It is admired all over for the quality of its academic courses, its community outreach work and as a university of compassion and humanitarianism. It has become a case study because no other educational institution in India has grown in its scope and scale as much as KIIT has in a short span of 25 years. Its incredible transformation is truly a journey from Soil to Silver. KIIT started in 1992-93 as an Industrial Training Institution. However, 1997 is considered the base year for the University as undergraduate and postgraduate courses in Engineering, Management and Computer Applications were added. In 2007, many new schools were added to its umbrella – School of Law, Biotechnology, Medical Sciences, Dental Sciences, Nursing, Mass Communication, Film and Media, Fashion and KIIT International School. Since then, there has been no looking back! Today, KIIT offers professional education to around 40,000 students from across India. This includes 2000 international students from 65 countries. The alumni of KIIT, over a lakh of them, have made their mark in their respective careers in academics, corporate organisations, civil services and enterprise.",

In particular, for people with mental health conditions and substance dependency issues. We design a specially curated, safe platform for the individual with telltale stories. A story that is so profound that it became an enabler that empowers and inspires you to tell your story to move the world. In the process, it assists others in getting out of their shells and creating a flourishing wheel. The one question we need to ask is, how can I destigmatise it all; it hurts as it affects my social life.

Change and growth in organisations and individuals is only lasting when it come from ‘inside-out’ rather than ‘outside-in’. Our transformation modules concentrate on inspiring minds within companies so that their decision-making, leadership and execution is propelled by inspired thinking. ‘Ergos’ is a Greek word that means ‘faithful execution of a task’. Hence, Ergos Mind aims to inspire thought processes that will lead to impactful execution.",

This frustration lead to Johan Poolman teaming up with Dr Dieter Veldsman to develop the Flow@Work employee engagement model, which ultimately morphed into a team of HR tech and startup veterans, industrial psychologists, software engineers, and data scientists who share the common belief that organizations can truly drive sustainable employee engagement - provided they are given the right data, tools, and know-how. With this as our focus, Mindset is now an international team with big plans, and our vision has not changed: we still believe that driving sustainable engagement requires the right information, in the right hands, at the right time.

    "description": "Our Founder, Saravana Kumar after 10 years of working as a software consultant in London identified a gap in the availability of necessary tools in the market when it comes to managing and monitoring Microsoft BizTalk Server environments. In 2010, he was attending a Microsoft conference in Redmond, Washington and he floated an idea with fellow technology enthusiasts. After returning, he spent a year building the initial version. At the same conference, the following year (2011), he demonstrated what he had built and everyone was blown away seeing the potential of the product. He received a lot of feedback, fine tuned the product and finally launched it in June 2011 as BizTalk360 which is our first product. Within a couple of weeks, he received the first order from Hong Kong. Slowly but steadily the company started to grow organically.",

We are committed to recognising and supporting caregivers by providing comprehensive, end-to-end services for caregivers and their loved ones in need of care, offering a wide array of resources, programs, support groups and an intuitive app to help manage care effectively. Being a caregiver to a loved one facing a terminal illness or chronic condition is an incredibly challenging journey. There are everyday challenges of a whole new life -with visits to the doctor, the struggles of discovering that your loved one is ill and the challenges of keeping the spirits up for the loved one and even, for the rest of the family. Often, the new situation is so overwhelming and consuming that the caregiver simply goes about doing their best without really paying attention to themselves. Emotions like anger and pain at the situation, sometimes guilt of not looking after the patient as well as they wished to, guilt of thinking about themselves and the loss of one’s life as one had hoped it to be. Given the social context in India, most caregivers feel such emotions have no place.",

We formed Nixfon because we found very few technology companies really understood HR’s needs, pains and processes. We were a bunch of HR and Learning guys who got intrigued by technology. We knew moving forward technology would change the whole HR and Learning & Development (L&D) landscape. We want to be the trusted advisors that HR, L&D managers and organizations can depend on when they are sourcing for systems and solutions for their Digital Transformation. Our continued focus in HR and Learning Technology gave us the opportunity to partner with some of the best Learning Technology and Learning content vendors in the world.

Beyond that, interviewing here can be a great way to get your foot in the door at top companies. When you do well in practice, you’ll start getting invitations to interview anonymously with great companies right on our platform. If you do well in those interviews, you can unmask, and they count as your technical phone screen. The next step is almost always an onsite. In other words, you can get interviews at top companies without ever touching your resume, applying, haranguing your friends for referrals, or talking to recruiters.",
