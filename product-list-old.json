We are committed to recognising and supporting caregivers by providing comprehensive, end-to-end services for caregivers and their loved ones in need of care, offering a wide array of resources, programs, support groups and an intuitive app to help manage care effectively. Being a caregiver to a loved one facing a terminal illness or chronic condition is an incredibly challenging journey. There are everyday challenges of a whole new life -with visits to the doctor, the struggles of discovering that your loved one is ill and the challenges of keeping the spirits up for the loved one and even, for the rest of the family. Often, the new situation is so overwhelming and consuming that the caregiver simply goes about doing their best without really paying attention to themselves. Emotions like anger and pain at the situation, sometimes guilt of not looking after the patient as well as they wished to, guilt of thinking about themselves and the loss of one’s life as one had hoped it to be. Given the social context in India, most caregivers feel such emotions have no place.",

We registered Nixfon (M) Sdn Bhd as business in November 2003 and started to hit the ground running. We formed Nixfon because we found very few technology companies really understood HR’s needs, pains and processes. We were a bunch of HR and Learning guys who got intrigued by technology. We knew moving forward technology would change the whole HR and Learning & Development (L&D) landscape. We want to be the trusted advisors that HR, L&D managers and organizations can depend on when they are sourcing for systems and solutions for their Digital Transformation. Our continued focus in HR and Learning Technology gave us the opportunity to partner with some of the best Learning Technology and Learning content vendors in the world. With a wide range of complimenting products and services, we can safely say we are one of the leading regional firms in Learning technology space.",

The center will also offer sector specific programs in tourism and aviation, teacher and school development, and management programs for key industries such as hospitality, travel and tourism, construction, and agriculture.

This could be acute and chronic illnesses to more urgent and emergency medical situations.\n The all important Preventive care can only be dispensed and monitored effectively at a robust Primary Care System. A large section of our population working in Industrial complexes and Corporate Houses which are growing, need a robust Preventive Occupational Health care service and Industrial Hygiene at their on-site modern clinics.\n It is our endeavour to have a chain of high quality Health Centres with all the services required to bridge the huge gap that exists at present in people’s health care needs. Each Healthspring Centre in the location brings all the health care services under one roof- for individual, family, community, corporate houses and Industrial complexes",

Since that time, we have grown into a full-circle agency, addressing many of the needs of the economically disadvantaged. In its 29th year of operation, the belief of empowering families is still strong within the agency. The concept of “community action” was originally conceived as part of the War on Poverty Program launched by the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964. Community Action objectives focused on enabling people to achieve self-sufficiency and providing them with the resources to achieve that goal. The concept of community action, people working together to help people, became widely known throughout the Northern Panhandle. As the concept grew, additional services were developed and interest continued to grow in the community.",

After India's independence in 1947, the economic policies of the Indian Government emphasised the need for local production. NESTLÉ responded to India's aspirations by forming a company in India and set up its first factory in 1961 at Moga, Punjab, where the Government wanted NESTLÉ to develop the milk economy. Progress in Moga required the introduction of NESTLÉ's Agricultural Services to educate, advise and help the farmer in a variety of aspects. From increasing the milk yield of their cows through improved dairy farming methods, to irrigation, scientific crop management practices and helping with the procurement of bank loans. NESTLÉ set up milk collection centres that would not only ensure prompt collection and pay fair prices, but also instil amongst the community, a confidence in the dairy business. Progress involved the creation of prosperity on an on-going and sustainable basis that has resulted in not just the transformation of Moga into a prosperous and vibrant milk district today, but a thriving hub of industrial activity, as well.",

There were many local payroll companies, but they were unable to deliver cost effective and high-quality results because of the complex management structure, extensive overheads and Tier-1 software solutions.

In 1964, all of these colleges amalgamated to form a unique Indian university of international standing, christened the Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, known to many as BITS, Pilani.\r\n\r\nOver the years, BITS has provided the highest quality technical education to students from all over India admitted on the basis of merit. Its graduates can be found worldwide in all areas of engineering, science, and commerce.

Beyond that, interviewing here can be a great way to get your foot in the door at top companies.

If you do well in those interviews, you can unmask, and they count as your technical phone screen. The next step is almost always an onsite.

It has become a case study because no other educational institution in India has grown in its scope and scale as much as KIIT has in a short span of 25 years. Its incredible transformation is truly a journey from Soil to Silver. KIIT started in 1992-93 as an Industrial Training Institution. However, 1997 is considered the base year for the University as undergraduate and postgraduate courses in Engineering, Management and Computer Applications were added. In 2007, many new schools were added to its umbrella – School of Law, Biotechnology, Medical Sciences, Dental Sciences, Nursing, Mass Communication, Film and Media, Fashion and KIIT International School. Since then, there has been no looking back! Today, KIIT offers professional education to around 40,000 students from across India. This includes 2000 international students from 65 countries. The alumni of KIIT, over a lakh of them, have made their mark in their respective careers in academics, corporate organisations, civil services and enterprise.",

This frustration lead to Johan Poolman teaming up with Dr Dieter Veldsman to develop the Flow@Work employee engagement model, which ultimately morphed into a team of HR tech and startup veterans, industrial psychologists, software engineers, and data scientists who share the common belief that organizations can truly drive sustainable employee engagement - provided they are given the right data, tools, and know-how. With this as our focus, Mindset is now an international team with big plans, and our vision has not changed: we still believe that driving sustainable engagement requires the right information, in the right hands, at the right time. Follow our story as we continue to grow, driving innovation and helping to build workplaces that we as employees - and as people - would be proud to be a part of.",

This belief drives us to make employability & life skills learning accessible to all, especially in the service sector. This sector is home to one of the largest workforces in India & their distinct lack of learning opportunities leads to a huge skill gap & aspiration to ability mismatch. The Koach.AI platform enables youth to gain critical skills to GET their first job, KEEP their jobs, and GROW their careers meaningfully. Our foundation is the Science of Coaching, which applies to all endeavors of performance & helps individuals internalize what they need to focus on. By combining the KoachUp platform with a unique classroom pedagogy and 1:1 mentor support, Koach takes learning from a linear to a blended pedagogy to help individuals assimilate & apply skills practically. Having tested our approach across youth in different cities, Koach is proud to have brought out a significant improvement in their life skills (verified by 3rd-party Assessment), placing them in their first jobs.",

Often organisations tend to focus on changing things in individuals and teams at a surface level but overlook the power of the ‘mind’!\n The ‘mind’ is where most battles are fought, where decisions are made and where inspiration is birthed. Change and growth in organisations and individuals is only lasting when it come from ‘inside-out’ rather than ‘outside-in’. Our transformation modules concentrate on inspiring minds within companies so that their decision-making, leadership and execution is propelled by inspired thinking. ‘Ergos’ is a Greek word that means ‘faithful execution of a task’. Hence, Ergos Mind aims to inspire thought processes that will lead to impactful execution.",

Since 2007, Isabelle has been working in various cities in India. In the past few years Isabelle was engaged in senior management positions for BMW and Liebherr. After managing a team of 100+ people it became evident that the most important ingredient for success is an effective leadership style. Isabelle implemented learning's from the work with her horses to the business environment. Later she became a qualified educator based on the HorseDream concept and inspired many business leaders to adopt a more effective leadership style through her workshops with horses.",

Leveraging extensive experience in the HR industry and expertise in statutory compliance, the payroll and HR outsourcing division was created in 2012, offering reliable and cost-effective solutions to Malaysian businesses. In 2020, CareerXcell embarked on a new venture with The Ability Center, Japan, marking the beginning of a new era as CXL. Expansion plans were set in motion, leading to the establishment of the Executive Search division, which employs a unique recruitment methodology tailored to today’s business landscape. In 2023 CXL merged with Whyze Solutions, a Singapore based HR & Payroll platform provider. This was an opportunity to create competitive advantage and value, while ensuring sustainability, through digital transformation is more compelling than ever.

We had a common conviction that there had to be a simple yet powerful way to help the software application users to figure out how the application works and how to become good at using it. At the same time, existing solutions were too rigid and lacked intelligence. Gyde was conceptualized as a faster, simpler, and intelligent way to solve this problem at scale.",

In 2010, he was attending a Microsoft conference in Redmond, Washington and he floated an idea with fellow technology enthusiasts. After returning, he spent a year building the initial version. At the same conference, the following year (2011), he demonstrated what he had built and everyone was blown away seeing the potential of the product. He received a lot of feedback, fine tuned the product and finally launched it in June 2011 as BizTalk360 which is our first product. Within a couple of weeks, he received the first order from Hong Kong. Slowly but steadily the company started to grow organically.",
